Begin with pike push-ups at a 45° angle, progressing to 60° and then 90° as strength increases. Research shows that isometric holds at your current maximum position create the neural adaptations necessary for progression.',

I recommend 400m interval training at 95% effort with 1:1 work-to-rest ratio, 2x weekly.',
