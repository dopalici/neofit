**Timeline:** Phased implementation approach with initial placeholder site in approximately 2 weeks, followed by gradual feature expansion. Brand deck development will take 1.5-2 weeks with core elements completed alongside the placeholder site launch.

## 2. Project Context  
**Client background:** Pilates By Ang is a new premium Reformer Pilates studio founded by Angharad Cook and Fabrice Burkhalter. Angharad transitioned from a career in fashion and beauty to pursue her passion for Pilates. After moving to White City, she identified a gap in the local wellness scene for personalized, challenging, and community-driven Pilates classes.

**Business need:** As a new business preparing to open in White City, Pilates By Ang needs to establish a strong online presence to attract clients, communicate their unique value proposition, and facilitate class bookings. The landing page will serve as their primary digital marketing tool during the crucial launch phase, initially acting as a placeholder site to capture leads and announce the upcoming launch, then evolving to support full studio operations.

**Target audience:** Primarily women and men aged 25-55, middle to high-income individuals, professionals, and health-conscious individuals who prioritize fitness and wellness. This includes local residents of White City, workers in the area, and visitors to Westfield White City shopping center.

## 3. Objectives & Success Criteria  
**Primary objective:** Create a visually appealing, user-friendly landing page that effectively communicates Pilates By Ang's unique value proposition, drives class bookings, and builds a community of Pilates enthusiasts in the White City area.

- Increased awareness of Pilates By Ang in the White City area
- Consistent flow of class bookings through the Mindbody integration
- Positive user feedback on website usability and design

- Establishment of a strong brand identity online that matches the in-studio experience
- Effective lead capture during the pre-launch phase

**Key requirement:** The landing page must effectively communicate the premium, personalized nature of Pilates By Ang's services while making it easy for potential clients to book classes and learn about the benefits of Reformer Pilates. The design must reflect a high-end aesthetic that showcases the studio's premium positioning, guided by the streamlined brand deck.
